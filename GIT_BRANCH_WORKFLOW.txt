# --- FEATURE BRANCH WORKFLOW FOR GITHUB ---

# 1. Create and switch to new branch (replace "feature123" with your branch name)
git checkout -b feature123

# 2. Make changes, then add and commit as usual
git add .
git commit -m "Describe your feature or fix"

# 3. Push new branch to GitHub (first time use -u)
git push -u origin feature123

# 4. To merge into main (locally, if you do not want to use GitHub PRs):
git checkout main
git pull --rebase origin main
git merge feature123
git push origin main

# Optionally, you can use the GitHub website to open a Pull Request from "feature123" to "main" for code review or CI testing.
